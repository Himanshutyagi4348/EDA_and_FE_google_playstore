📊 Google Play Store Dataset - EDA & Feature Engineering
🧠 Overview
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering on the Google Play Store dataset. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights, clean and transform the data, and prepare it for Machine Learning applications.

By analyzing the dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I was able to visualize trends, handle inconsistencies, engineer relevant features, and create a clean, ML-ready dataset.

✅ Objectives
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct EDA to extract actionable insights

Apply feature engineering to improve data quality

Prepare the dataset for machine learning operations

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical plotting

NumPy – Numerical operations

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development

📈 Key Insights
Distribution of app categories and installs

Correlation between app ratings, size, and type (Free/Paid)

Popularity of free vs paid apps

Impact of content rating and app pricing on user engagement

🧪 Feature Engineering Steps
Handled missing and incorrect data

Transformed string-based numeric fields

Encoded categorical variables

Normalized numerical features

Created new features like app_age, price_category, etc.
